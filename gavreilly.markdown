Every name and number of the EU 2024 election data here I owe to [Gavan Reilly](https://x.com/gavreilly), Political Correspondent at Virgin Media News and columnist with the [Meath Chronicle](https://www.meathchronicle.ie/) and the [Sunday Independent](https://www.independent.ie/).

The general election content that is (hopefully) coming I got from data.gov.ie, but Gavan Reilly has led the field in serving deep data to the public to the extent of being a field by himself, and more power to him.

He's been religous in posting and updating Google Sheets for the past four Euro and General Elections, and has matched and surpassed the major outlets in terms of timing and accessibility. Whatever he's being paid, it isn't enough.
