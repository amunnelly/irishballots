Fianna came within two seats of its first overall majority since 1977 in the 2002 "Showtime" election. And then, the apocalypse. The Banking Crisis of 2008 saw the electorate take a terrible revenge on the once-unconquerable Fianna Fáil machine, quartering their seat count and leaving the party on the brink of extinction. And the question now is: will Fianna Fáil continue its slow comeback to dominance? Will fragmentation continue with the largest-ever Non-Party representation in the next Dáil, or is the nation at a turning point where, 103 years after independence, a new politics is about to be born?
