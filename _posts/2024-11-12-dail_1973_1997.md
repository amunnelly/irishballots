Ireland entered the EU, or the EEC as it was then, on January 1st, 1973. The next 24 years saw a quarter-century of either stability or stagnation, depending on one's politics. The two-and-a-half party system dominated through all the events of those years. The Spring tide came in 1992 and ebbed by 1997, with Fianna Fáil's dominance seeming as inevitable as the seasons.
