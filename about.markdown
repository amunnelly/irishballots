Visualisations of Irish election data under three species, as they say:
* Inter-candidate transfers,
* Inter-party transfers, and
* Dirty big stacked bar charts like mother used to make.

This is a [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) site, and the visualisations are made with [d3.js, version 7](https://d3js.org/)

I’ve another site here, [https://anthony-munnelly.com/](https://anthony-munnelly.com/), but that’s made with 11ty and I couldn’t quite get the `d3` to work on that. I had to go a bit McGyver to get it to work here, to be quite honest with you. There'll be more about `d3` on that site soon, I hope.
